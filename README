django-auth-longer-email by Michael Huynh (mike@mikexstudios.com)

This is a very simple (one file that is __init__.py)... 
whose purpose is to dynamically patch django...
in order to increase the length of the email field for auth.User to 254 char.

Tested:
------
Only on Django 1.1.1.

Why?
----
Currently, the email field has max_length = 75. However, the standards for
email addresses state that email length can be up to 254 characters.
Therefore, there will be cases where django's auth.User cannot save a valid
email address.

(Specifically, this app to address facebook's very long proxy email
addresses.) 
Edit: Ironically, like a half-hour after I finished writing this app, RPX
decided not to send the email field from facebook logins anymore.
Nevertheless, an email field length of 75 seems way too low.


How to use
----------
1. Install this app through pip, or copy the app to your django project
   directory.

2. Edit settings.py and under INSTALLED_APPS, add 'django_auth_longer_email'
   before 'django.contrib.auth'.

3. If the auth_user table already exists, drop it (or rename it for now).

4. Run manage.py syncdb to recreate the auth_user table, this time with the
   longer email field.
